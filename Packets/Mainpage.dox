/** \mainpage The SENF Packet Library

    \section arch Overall Architecture

    The Packet library consists of several components:
    
    \li The \ref packet_module manages the packet data and provides the framework for handling the
        chain of packet headers. The visible interface is provided by the Packet class.
    \li \ref packetparser provides the framework for interpreting packet data. It handles
        parsing the packet information into meaningful values.
    \li The \ref protocolbundles provide concrete implementations for interpreting packets of
        some protocol. The Protocol Bundles are built on top of the basic packet library.

    All these components work together to provide a hopefully simple and intuitive interface to
    packet parsing and creation.

    \section intro Introduction

    Whenever using the library, you will probably need to \c \#include it's header:

    \code
    #include "Packets/Packets.hh"
    \endcode

    \warning Never include any other Packets library header directly, always include \c
    Packets/Packets.hh.

    Additionally you will have to include the header files for the packet types you use, e.g. \c
    Packets/DefaultBundle/EthernetPacket.hh etc.
    
    Most every use of the packet library starts with some concrete packet typedef. Some fundamental
    packet types are provided by \ref protocolbundle_default. Building on those packet types, this
    example will build a complex packet: This will be an Ethernet packet containing an IPv4 UDP
    packet. We begin by building the raw packet skeleton:

    \code
    senf::EthernetPacket eth      (senf::EthernetPacket::create());
    senf::IPv4Packet     ip       (senf::IPv4Packet    ::createAfter(eth));
    senf::UDPPacket      udp      (senf::UDPPacket     ::createAfter(ip));
    senf::DataPacket     payload  (senf::DataPacket    ::createAfter(udp, 
                                                                     std::string("Hello, world!")));
    \endcode

    These commands create what is called an interpreter chain. This chain consists of four
    interpreters. All interpreters reference the same data storage. This data storage is a random
    access sequence which contains the data bytes of the packet.

    \note The data structures allocated are automatically managed using reference counting. In this
        example we have four packet references each referencing the same underlying data
        structure. This data structure will be freed when the last reference to it goes out of
        scope.

    The packet created above already has the correct payload however all protocol fields are
    empty. We need to set those protocol fields:

    \code
    udp->source()      = 2000u;
    udp->destination() = 2001u;
    ip->ttl()          = 255u;
    ip->source()       = senf::INet4Address::from_string("192.168.0.1");
    ip->destination()  = senf::INet4Address::from_string("192.168.0.2");
    eth->source()      = senf::MACAddress::from_string("00:11:22:33:44:55");
    eth->destination() = senf::MACAddress::from_string("00:11:22:33:44:66");
    
    eth.finalize();
    \endcode

    As seen above, packet fields are accessed using the <tt>-></tt> operator whereas other packet
    facilities (like \c finalize()) are directly accessed using the member operator. The field
    values are simple set using appropriately named accessors. As a last step, the \c finalize()
    call will update all calculated fields (fields like next-protocol, header or payload length,
    checksums etc). Now the packet is ready. We may now send it out using a packet socket

    \code
    senf::PacketSocketHandle sock ("eth0");
    sock.write(eth.data());
    \endcode

    The packet library also provides lot's of facilities to navigate the packet chain:

    \code
    eth.next() == ip;                   // true
    eth.next().is<IPv4Packet>();        // true
    eth.next().next() == udp;           // true
    eth.next().is<UDPPacket>();         // false
    eth.find<UDPPacket>() == udp;       // true

    udp.find<EthernetPacket>();         // throws InvalidPacketChainException
    udp.find<EthernetPacket>(senf::nothrow); // An in-valid() senf::Packet which tests as 'false'
    udp.find<UDPPacket()> == udp;       // true
    udp.first<IPv4Packet>();            // throws InvalidPacketChainException

    udp.prev() == ip;                   // true
    udp.prev<EthernetPacket>();         // throws Inv
    \endcode

    ... and so on. See the senf::Packet documentation for more. Using these members, the complete
    chain of packet interpreters (as these sub-packets or headers are called) may be traversed from
    any packet handle.

    These chain navigation functions are also used to parse a packet. Let's read an Ethernet packet
    from a packet socket handle:
    
    \code
    senf::PacketSocketHandle sock ("eth0");
    senf::EthernetPacket packet (senf::EthernetPacket::create(senf::Packet::noinit));
    sock.read(packet.data(),0u);
    \endcode

    This first creates an uninitialized Ethernet packet and then reads into this packet. We can now
    parse this packet. Let's find out, whether this is a UDP packet destined to port 2001:

    \code
    try {
        senf::UDPPacket udp (packet.find<UDPPacket>());
        if (udp->destination() == 2001u) {
            // Voila ...
        }
    } catch (senf::TruncatedPacketException &) {
        std::cerr << "Ooops !! Broken packet received\n";
    } catch (senf::InvalidPacketChainException &) {
        std::cerr << "Not a udp packet\n";
    }
    \endcode

    TruncatedPacketException is thrown by <tt>udp->destination()</tt> if that field cannot be
    accessed (that is it would be beyond the data read which means we have read a truncated
    packet). More generally, whenever a field cannot be accessed because it would be out of bounds
    of the data read, this exception is generated.

    This is only a very short introduction to the library to give a feel for the implementation. For
    a detailed discussion see the respective reference documentation.

/** \defgroup protocolbundles Protocol Bundles

    Each protocol bundle provides a collection of related concrete packet classes for a group of
    related protocols:

    \li <a href="../../DefaultBundle/doc/html/index.html">DefaultBundle</a>: Some basic
        default protocols: Ethernet, Ip, TCP, UDP
    \li <a href="../../MPEGDVBBundle/doc/html/index.html">MPEGDVBBundle</a>: MPEG and DVB
        protocols

    There are two ways to link with a bundle
    
    \li If you only work with known packets which you explicitly reference you may just link with
        the corresponding library.
    \li If you need to parse unknown packets and want those to be parsed as complete as possible
        without explicitly referencing the packet type, you will need to link against the combined
        object file built for every bundle. This way, all packets defined in the bundle will be
        included whether they are explicitly referenced or not (and they will all automatically be
        registered).
