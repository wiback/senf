Architecture: any
Description: SENF Extensible Network Framework, static library
 The SENF Simple and Extensible Network Framework aims to be a
 complete set of libraries to facilitate the development of network
 applications focusing on network protocols on the layers below the
 application layer. However, the framework includes many general
 purpose utilities and will be expedient to use well beyond its primary
 objective.
