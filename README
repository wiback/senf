SENF: The Simple and Extensible Network Framework
-------------------------------------------------

The SENF Simple and Extensible Network Framework aims to be a complete
set of libraries to facilitate the development of network applications
focusing on network protocols on the layers below the application
layer. However, the framework includes many general purpose utilities
and will be expedient to use well beyond its primary objective.

Goals
-----

The main goals of this library are (in no particular order): 

 - modular framework design
 - utilizing the power of modern C++
 - very low overhead for frequently called members
 - extensible design
 - concise interface
