This directory contains all SENF modules that make up the emulator layer:
  - PPI modules (meta data, packet flow analyzer, loss, latency, etc)
  - topology information (node position, links & link groups)
  - logging, measurement 

To compile this, check NetEmu out directly into the PPI folder of a SENF checkout
and rebuild SENF (with a complete rebuild, NetEmu will be added to the documentation
menu)
