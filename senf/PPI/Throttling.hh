    /** \brief Throttling discipline base class

        ThrottlingDiscipline derived classes define the generation of throttling notifications. The
        ThrottlingDiscipline is called whenever the packets are entered or removed from the queue. The
        throttling discipline then determines the new throttling state of the queue.

        \note The ThrottlingDiscipline will \e never drop packets explicitly. This is left to the
        operating system by sending throttling events. The PPI will never loose a packet internally
        (if not a module explicitly does so), however it may disable reception of new incoming
        packets which will then probably be dropped by the operating system.

        \attention Notifications may be forwarded to the ThrottlingDiscipline implementation
            out-of-order: A dequeue event may be notified before the corresponding enqueue
            event (this happens to optimize away transient throttling state changes which would
            otherwise occur if a packet is entered into the queue and then removed from it in the
            same processing step).
