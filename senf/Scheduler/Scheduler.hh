/** \brief The Scheduler interface

    The %scheduler API is comprised of two parts:

    \li Specific \ref sched_objects, one for each type of event.
    \li Some <a href="#autotoc-7.">generic functions</a> implemented in the \ref senf::scheduler
        namespace.

    Events are registered via the respective event class. The (global) functions are used to enter
    the application main-loop or query for global information.

    \autotoc


    \section sched_objects Event classes

    The Scheduler is based on the RAII principle: Every event is represented by a class
    instance. The event is registered in the constructor and removed by the destructor of that
    instance. This implementation automatically links the lifetime of an event with the lifetime of
    the object responsible for it's creation.

    Every event registration is represented by an instance of an event specific class:

    \li senf::scheduler::FdEvent for file descriptor events
    \li senf::scheduler::TimerEvent for single-shot deadline timer events
    \li senf::scheduler::SignalEvent for UNIX signal events
    \li senf::scheduler::EventHook for a special event hook

    These instance are owned and managed by the user of the %scheduler \e not by the %scheduler so
    the RAII concept can be used.

    \code
    class SomeServer
    {
        SomeSocketHandle handle_;
        senf::scheduler::FdEvent event_;

    public:
        SomeServer(SomeSocketHandle handle)
            : handle_ (handle),
              event_ ("SomeServer handler", senf::membind(&SomeServer::readData, this),
                      handle, senf::scheduler::FdEvent::EV_READ)
        {}

        void readData(int events)
        {
            // read data from handle_, check for eof and so on.
        }
    };
    \endcode

    The event is defined as a class member variable. When the event member is initialized in the
    constructor, the event is automatically registered (except if the optional \a initiallyEnabled
    flag argument is set to \c false). The Destructor will automatically remove the event from the
    %scheduler and ensure, that no dead code is called accidentally.

    The process is the same for the other event types or when registering multiple events. For
    detailed information on the constructor arguments and other features see the event class
    documentation referenced below.


    \section sched_handlers Specifying handlers

    All handlers are specified as generic <a
    href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/functional/index.html">Boost.Function</a>
    objects. This allows to pass any callable as a handler. Depending on the type of handler,
    some additional arguments may be passed to the handler by the %scheduler.

    If you need to pass additional information to your handler, use <a
    href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/bind/bind.html">Boost.Bind</a>:
    \code
    // Handle callback function
    void callback(UDPv4ClientSocketHandle handle, senf::Scheduler::EventId event) {..}
    // Pass 'handle' as additional first argument to callback()
    senf::scheduler::FdEvent event ("name", boost::bind(&callback, handle, _1),
                                    handle, senf::scheduler::FdEvent::EV_READ);
     // Timeout function
    void timeout( int n) {..}
    // Call timeout() handler with argument 'n'
    senf::scheduler::TimerEvent timer ("name", boost::bind(&timeout, n),
                                       senf::ClockService::now() + senf::ClockService::seconds(1));
    \endcode

    To use member-functions as callbacks, use either <a
    href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/bind/bind.html">Boost.Bind</a> or senf::membind()
    \code
    // e.g. in Foo::Foo() constructor:
    Foo::Foo()
        : handle_ (...),
          readevent_ ("Foo read", senf::membind(&Foo::callback, this),
                      handle_, senf::scheduler::FdEvent::EV_READ)
    { ... }
    \endcode

    The handler is identified by an arbitrary, user specified name. This name is used in error
    messages to identify the failing handler.


    \section sched_exec Executing the Scheduler

    To enter the %scheduler main-loop, call

    \code
    senf::scheduler::process();
    \endcode

    This call will only return in two cases:

    \li When a handler calls senf::scheduler::terminate()
    \li When there is no active file descriptor or timer event.

    Additional <a href="#autotoc-7.">generic functions</a> provide information and %scheduler
    parameters.

    \section sched_container Event objects and container classes

    As the event objects are \e not copyable, they cannot be placed into ordinary
    containers. However, it is quite simple to use pointer containers to hold event instances:

    \code
    #include <boost/ptr_container/ptr_map.hpp>
    #include <boost/bind.hpp>

    class Foo
    {
    public:
        void add(int fd)
        {
            fdEvents.insert(
                fd,
                new senf::scheduler::FdEvent("foo", boost::bind(&callback, this, fd, _1), fd,
                                             senf::scheduler::FdEvent::EV_READ) );
        }

        void callback(int fd, int events)
        {
            FdEvent & event (fdEvents_[fd]);

            // ...

            if (complete)
                fdEvents_.remove(fd)
        }

    private:
        boost::ptr_map<int, FdEvent> fdEvents_;
    };
    \endcode

    The pointer container API is (almost) completely identical to the corresponding standard library
    container API. The only difference is, that all elements added to the container \e must be
    created via \c new and that the pointer containers themselves are \e not copyable (ok, they are,
    if the elements are cloneable ...). See <a
    href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/ptr_container/doc/ptr_container.html">Boost.PointerContainer</a>
    for the pointer container library reference.


    \section sched_signals Signals and the Watchdog

    To secure against blocking callbacks, the %scheduler implementation includes a watchdog
    timer. This timer will produce a warning message on the standard error stream when a single
    callback is executing for more than the watchdog timeout value. Since the %scheduler
    implementation is completely single threaded, we cannot terminate the callback but at least we
    can produce an informative message and optionally the program can be aborted.

    The watchdog is controlled using the watchdogTimeout(), watchdogEvents() and watchdogAbort().
    functions.

    The watchdog is implemented using a free running interval timer. The watchdog signal (\c SIGURG)
    must \e not be blocked. If signals need to be blocked for some reason, those regions will not be
    checked by the watchdog. If a callback blocks, the watchdog has no chance to interrupt the
    process.

    \warning Since the watchdog is free running for performance reasons, every callback must expect
        signals to happen. Signals \e will certainly happen since the watchdog signal is generated
        periodically (which does not necessarily generate a watchdog event ...)

    Additional signals (\c SIGALRM) may occur when using using hires timers on kernel/glibc
    combinations which do not support timerfd(). On such systems, hires timers are implemented using
    POSIX timers which generate a considerable number of additional signals.

    \todo Fix the file support to use threads (?) fork (?) and a pipe so it works reliably even
        over e.g. NFS.
