// The private inheritance idea should indeed work very well: We just need to change the
// implementations of body() and protocol() and that of the ProtocolClient/ServerSocketHandle
// constructors and the SocketBody constructor. The body and the protocol would still be visible
// like several instances because of the private inheritance but we would save the backwards
// pointer.

/** \defgroup protocol_group The Protocol Classes

    \diaimage Protocols.dia

    The socket handle classes and templates only implement the most important socket API methods
    using the policy framework. To access the complete API, the protocol interface is
    provided. Access to the protocol interface is only possible via senf::ProtocolClientSocketHandle
    and senf::ProtocolServerSocketHandle which have the necessary \c protocol() member. This member
    returns a reference to the protocol class instance which contains members covering all the API
    functions (mostly setsockopt/getsockopt related calls but there may be more, this is completely
    up to the implementor of the protocol class) not found in the SocketHandle interface. The
    protocol interface is specific to the protocol. It's implementation is quite free. The standard
    protocols are implemented using a simple multiple-inheritance hierarchy as shown above.

    Since the protocol class is protocol specific (how intelligent ...), the protocol class also
    defines the \e complete socket policy to be used with it's protocol. Complete meaning, that
    every policy axis must be assigned it's the most specific (that is derived) policy class to be
    used with the protocol and that no policy axis is allowed to be left unspecified.

/** \defgroup concrete_protocol_group Protocol Implementations (Concrete Protocol Classes)
    \ingroup protocol_group

    These protocol classes define concrete and complete protocol implementations. They inherit from
    ConcreteSocketProtocol and are used with the ProtocolClientSocketHandle and
    ProtocolServerSocketHandle templates to instantiate socket handles. Appropriate typedefs are
    always provided.

    Every protocol defines both the protocol and the policy interface provided by that protocol. See
    the documentation of the protocol classes listed below for more information on the supported
    protocols. Every protocol class documents it's policy interface. Use the 'list all members' link
    of the protocol class to find the complete policy interface.

    The protocol facets are classes used as building blocks to build concrete protocol classes. Each
    protocol facet will implement some functional part of the protocol interface. The protocol
    facets all inherit from SocketProtocol by public \e virtual inheritance. This ensures the
    accessibility of the socket body from all facets.

                                             Depending on the protocol, it may not be possible to

                                             available() is ok). However, this should only be done
                                             as a last resort. Also beware, that this number should
                                             not be too large since the socket layer will always
                                             need to allocate that number of bytes for the data to

                                             implementation defined.

                                             Every class derived from SocketProtocol should
                                             reimplement state(). The reimplemented method should
                                             call (all) baseclass-implementations of this
                                             member.

                                             The \a map Argument is a map which associates
                                             std:string keys with std:string-like values. The map
                                             keys are interpreted as hierarchical strings with '.'
                                             as a separator (like hostnames or struct or class
                                             members). They are automatically sorted correctly.

                                             The values are std:string with one additional feature:
                                             they allow assignment or conversion from *any* type as
                                             long as that type is streamable. This simplifies
                                             assigning non-string values to the map:

                                             \code
                                                 map["socket.protocol.ip.address"] << peer();
                                                 map["socket.protocol.tcp.backlog"] << backlog();
                                             \endcode

                                             This will work even if peer() returns an ip-address
                                             object or backlog() returns an integer. The values are
                                             automatically converted to their string representation.

                                             Additionally, if the slot the date is written to is not
                                             empty, the <tt>\<\<</tt> operator will add add a comma
                                             as separator. */

        ConcreteSocketProtocol is the base class of a concrete socket protocol implementation. The
        final protocol class must inherit from ConcreteSocketProtocol. The template argument \a
        SocketPolicy must be set to the complete socket policy of the protocol. \a Self is the name
        of the final protocol class which inherits this class.

        A protocol implementation may define the protocol interface directly. It can also
        (additionally) make use of multiple inheritance to combine a set of protocol facets into a
        specific protocol implementation (i.e. TCPv4SocketProtocol inherits from
        ConcreteSocketProtocol and from the protocol facets IPv4SocketProtocol, TCPSocketProtocol,
        BSDSocketProtocol and AddressableBSDSocketProtocol). The protocol facets are not concrete
        protocols themselves, they are combined to build concrete protocols. This structure will
        remove a lot of code duplication. It is important to ensure, that the protocol facets do not
        overlap, since otherwise there will be problems resolving overlapping members.
