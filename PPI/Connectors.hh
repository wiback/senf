        \brief Connector classes

        A connector has two independent properties
        \li it may be \e active or \e passive
        \li it may be an \e input or an \e output

        \e Active connectors are activated from within the module, \e passive connectors are
        signaled by the external framework. \e Input modules receive packets, \e output modules send
        packets.

        All passive connectors call some onRequest callback whenever I/O needs to be performed. All
        input modules possess a packet queue.

        We therefore have 4 connector types:
        \li senf::ppi::connector::ActiveInput
        \li senf::ppi::connector::ActiveOutput
        \li senf::ppi::connector::PassiveInput
        \li senf::ppi::connector::PassiveOutput.

        Connectors are declared as module data members and are then externally connected to other
        modules.

        The connectors each take an optional template argument. If this argument is specified, it
        must be the type of packet expected or sent on this connector. If it is not specified,
        packets will be passed using the generic Packet handle.

        \code
        class IpFilter : public senf::ppi::module::Module
        {
            SENF_PPI_MODULE(SomeModule);

        public:
            senf::ppi::connector::ActiveInput<senf::EthernetPacket> input;
            senf::ppi::connector::PassiveOutput<senf::IpPacket> output;

            IpFilter() {
                route(input, output);
                input.onRequest(&IpFilter::onRequest);
            }

        private:
            void onRequest() {
                // 'input()' will return a senf::EthernetPacket packet handle
                try { output( input().find<IpPacket>() ); }
                catch (senf::InvalidPacketChainException & ex) { ; }

        throttling.

        Passive connectors always handle two throttling states:

        \li The \e native throttling state is set manually by the module. It is the throttling state
            originating in the current module
        \li The \e forwarded throttling state is the state as it is received by throttling
            notifications

        The accumulative throttling state is generated by combining all sub-states.

    /** \brief Input connector base-class

        An input connector receives packets. It may be either an ActiveConnector or a
        PassiveConnector. An input connector contains a packet queue. This queue enables processing
        packets in batches or generating multiple output packets from a single input packet. The
        queues have the potential to greatly simplify the module implementations.

        \implementation Which container to use?
            \li list has good insertion and deletion properties on both ends but it costs a dynamic
                memory allocation for every insertion. A very good property is, that iterators stay
                valid across insertions/deletions
            \li vector is fast and has good amortized dynamic allocation properties. However, it is
                quite unusable as a queue
            \li deque has comparable dynamic allocation properties as vector but also has good
                insertion/removal properties on both ends.

            So probably we will use a deque. I'd like a container which keeps iterators intact on
            insertion/deletion but I believe that list is just to expensive since every packet will
            be added to the queue before it can be processed.
