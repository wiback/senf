/** \page console_testserver Test Server

    \dontinclude testServer.cc

    You can find this code in the \c testServer.cc source file.

    \skip Custom
    \skip #include
    \until namespace

    Here we see the necessary include files. For console support only <tt>senf/Console.hh</tt> needs
    to be included. This will pull in all necessary definitions.

    We declare an alias for the senf::console::kw namespace which we will use further down for the
    keyword arguments.

    \until echo
    \until }
    \until }

    The first callback \c echo utilizes \link console_manualparse manual argument
    parsing\endlink. You should always refer to the iterator types as shown here since this will be
    safe from future changes.

    The following \c struct \c TestObject is used to show how member functions and objects are used
    in the console.

    \until dir

    Important is the definition of the <b>public</b> senf::console::ScopedDirectory member called \c
    dir. This member can be used later to add the class to the node tree. Here we just register a
    single function \c vat (with \link console_autoparse automatic argument parsing\endlink) and
    set some command attributes.

    \until };

    The \c shutdownServer callback terminates the server.

    \until }

    This happens in two steps: First the \c terminate() call tells the scheduler to leave it's
    main-loop after shutdownServer returns (which is ultimately called via the console server from
    the scheduler). Throwing a senf::console::Executor::ExitException is like entering the \c exit
    built-in command at the console.

    The next callback accesses the client instance directly to manipulate the logging:
    
    \until }

    The senf::console::Client instance can be accessed using the senf::console::Client::get() helper
    via the output stream. Since every Client is a senf::log::Target, we can route arbitrary log
    messages to the console instance.

    We now define \c main() which initializes the node tree and starts the console server
    
    \until route
    
    Here we just setup more verbose logging and set \c SIGPIPE signals to be ignored. \c SIGPIPE's
    are a pain and really should be disabled.
    
    \until settings

    This shows, how to set the top-level documentation and create a new subdirectory directly

    \until mkdir

    Here we create another new directory but save a reference so we can later access the node
    directly. All the add commands return such a node reference of the correct type (this is a lie,
    but it works like this anyways and it's an implementation detail that must not concern you
    here).
    
    This way of stroing a refernce is not bad, but even better is to use a \c
    senf::console::ScopedDirectory<> for this

    \until functions
    
    This will automatically remove the node from the tree when the senf::console::ScopedDiretory
    instance is destroyed and keeps the node alive even when unlinked from the tree (a plain
    reference becomes invalid when anyone later unlinks the node from the tree). This is much safer
    and is the preferred way to keep a hold on a directory.

    The next statements add commands to the various directories declared so far
    
    \until Example

    We now continue by creating an instance of our test class \c TestObject
    
    \until Example

    We add that objects directory to the \c test dir. We now have created a directory structure like
    tis:
    <pre>
    /
      console/
        showlog
      server/
        shutdown
      test/
        echo
        testob/
          vat
    </pre>

    We now start the server (giving it a nice descriptive name) and run the scheduler.

    \until }
